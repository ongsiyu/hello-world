# hello-world
This is my first repository on the 8th day I'm at home for self-isolation due to COVID-19. It's been nice taking a breather from the usual clinical works and just catch up on other things that I've been lacking the time to, and today I'm picking up R. P.s. feels nice with a cup of tea, an adorable manta ray and a little cactus on my table.

Still finding my way around on Git, really new to it!
